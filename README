KDE Configuration

Problem:

1. Can't get new theme or other: use proxychains systemsettings
2. To remove kde title bar, edge and vscode(Search title bar) have setting to do this and Kwin scrip----hide title should be used with latte-dock to implement effect
like unity (Not recommended)


Theme:

1. Spectrum Malice
2. Konsole: Moe-Dark
